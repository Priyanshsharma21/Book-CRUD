It provides us the capablity of routing, controllers and we can listen on any port using express and make our frontend to intract with it


We have different type of request such as a GET request
Get -> To get data from the server
Post -> To post data to the server
Put and Patch -> To Update data (put -> replace whole data, patch -> replace only updated part)
Delete -> to delete data

Note-> we use curly braces to return and simple paranthesis when not returning in callback

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("hello duniya")
})

app.listen(PORT,()=>(
    console.log(`Listening at port ${PORT}`)
))

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests

We mainly have grt,post,put,patch,delete requests
On which route we want to perform which operation and send which data back to user is all routing

ex ->

app.get('/top-movies', (req,res)=>{
    res.json({
        name : 'Avatar',
        rating : 8.6,
        year : 2011
    })
})

when user make request on this route they wll get this information

Routing have route nd a handler function (callback)

We can have dynamic routes also

app.get('/top-movies/:movieId', (req,res)=>{
    const movieId = req.params.movieId
    res.json({
        name : 'Avatar',
        rating : 8.6,
        year : 2011
    })
})

route and controllers mut have same name singular form



For checking our eequests we use rapidApi
Create new request and in that
Get req is simple

For the post request set it to post, 
In header make -> content.type : application/json

Now you can make post request 
to get req.body
you can pass data in body in json format


Whatever data we are passing in post request we can get it using req.body.NAME_OF_FIELD



    const user = new User(req.body)
    user.save((user,err)=>{
        if(err){
            return res.status(400).json({error : "NOT ABLE TO SAVE DATA IN DB"})
        }

        res.json(user);
    })

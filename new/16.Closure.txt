Everything inside have access to its own variables and outer variables 
We have global variables can be accessed throught programe
Now we have function inside another function 

function outerfunction(outer){
    const outer2 = "Hello everyone"
    function innerfunction(inner){
        console.log(outer)
        console.log(inner)
        console.log(outer2)
    }
}

const myFunction = outerfunction("outer")

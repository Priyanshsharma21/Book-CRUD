If we are working on a project where we have to pass data from one compouent to other which we have to do in react now if its a small project then ok but in big projects where we have to pass data from lot of component even that component dont need that data we have to pass it hence we need something where we store those state and whoever need it we they can use it

Redux is external library for state management where we have redux store from where we store those state and whoever need it we they can use it

It makes global object so any compoent can use it, makes easy development and testing and consistancy easyness

concept is simple -> Any react component can read data from redux store, they can dispatch actions to store or update in order to change data, it chack if any change happens to data that component requesting nd re-render data


concept lifecycle ->
UI triggers Actions
Action send to reducer
Reducer update store
store contain state
state define UI
Repeat


Terms used - >
1. Action - Plane object tells intention to cause change, change in UI (means user have perform some actions) this triggers action(an object contain all the information tht what state has change and time of occerance, coordinates)

2. Action are send first to reducer dada - Reducer(pure function) dada only want payload(pure data)
Reducer dada ask action - tu bas yea bata ki data konsa change hua hai wao kya haina mako yea store mausi ko batana hai also I will update new state from previous 


Installation -  npm install redux react-redux
File and folder - 
components(navbar, sidebar),
container(home,crypto,news),
actions



Anology - > 

Baby(6 years) as UI
Mom Dad(busy working professionals and action creator)(MD) as Actions
Shankar maharaj(care taker) as Reducer

Scanario ->
Baby(UI) wants Bat and Ball

He ask Mom and Dad(Actions) for it

MD dispatch whatsapp message to shakar maharaj whose 
Type : 'BRING'
Payload : 1 Ball + bat

Now shankar is the one who actually do work of bringing the bat and ball

our react app consist mainly of state and components
When we work on big project our components increase and to maintqin state and props it become defucult

Example ->
We have a ecom website in which we have main 3 componments
shop, blog, ott 


shop has shopping components like cart, product
blog has different component like card,blogItems 
ott has different component like movie, series, login

now we want to send one props from movie(login) to shop login we have to traverse all the component and this became defiult

Insteed of creating state and pass from one component to other 
create a context
create context 
and now anyone can use it

we use (useContext) hook
using it debugging become easy and better management

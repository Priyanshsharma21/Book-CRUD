You are not sending the chunks
In which you send the whole cooked part to client which is HTML so it takes less time to load.


Perciously -> website only have html some css and js and no worries, hosted on serverna dn client fetch it

Now lot of complexity in website

Working : 
1. Req to server
2. Server render HTML and pre populate it with data

3. Server send HTML to client
4. Client make req to server for more data

Function provide bu react lib to create mutable reference of dom element in functional based component, it is used to manipulate dom.

we can create ref by -> 

const inputRef = useRef(null) //initial value

<input ref={inputRef} />


when we type something we get it in here ->
useRef hvae only one current property which have all the detail about the dom
inputRef.current.value

useRef donnt cause rerender but useState do

The useContext hook is a function provided by the react library that allows functional components to consume value from context. It's a way to access the value from context without pass data from one component to other via props

1. create context
2. Create provider function and default export it
3. this function will return context.Provider which accept value prop and have children which is all the components
4. Wrap your <App /> with this provider
5. create a hook at bottom using useContext(myContext)

const useCartContext = ()=>useContext(myContext)

and now we can use this look to get all the values in any component

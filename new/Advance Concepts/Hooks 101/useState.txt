Hooks -> Hooks are the function which hooks into lifecycle methods of class based component and provide all the features to functional based component in much easy way.
Hooks completly replace the class based component and now functional based component are used in react which are stateless component (means independent of state)




1. useState hook -> It is a function provide by react library that allow functional based component to have state
we can manage state of our application using useState without having class and constructor

useState takes initial state as args -> useState(0), useState(''), useState([]), useState({})
and return array of two elements : 
1. Value,
2. Function to change that value,


ex -> 

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

setCount(count + 1)

We should not directly tell setCOunt to update the value otherwise it will not rerender in dom,

We can have multiple useState

Both are used to hold some information, which may change over time.

we can pass state from one component to other which depent on owner and need, wether a compone t should share itds state

Props are input to component, just like html attributr naming combentin we can use prips to send data from parent to child component

we can send state, or setState also

Note -> direct update the state like

const [state, setState]= useState("Priyansh")

state="shreyansh"
this will not cause rerenedr and not update the virtual dom

setState("shreyansh") will make change in virtual dom and hance correct


state can be change but props can't


The React philosophy is that props should be immutable and top-down. This means that
a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can't modify received props.

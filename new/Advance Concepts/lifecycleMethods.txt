!The series of events happen with a component from its mounting to unmounting
Mounting - Birth of component(when it comes in existance)
update - Growth of a component
Unmounting - Death of a compontnt


!Methods of lifeCycle ->

1. Render ->
Use to render html(jsx) in react app,
use by class bases component, 
use in mounting and updating,
In this cant update state

Render is also a lifecycle method which will transpile the code babel so browser can understand it
 


2. componentDidMount()
once our jsx,html render on dom this method runs after that
can change state in it 
working -> 
1. constructor will run -> render method -> react update dom and refs -> componentdidmount()




3. componentDidUpdate()
It runs when our component changes(updates) like new Props or state changes 
Api resounce changes

props change, setState runs or forceUpdate() -> render method -> react update dom and refs -> componentDidUpdate()

4. componentWillUnmount()
Just before unmount of a component we use this 
Use in cleanup resources

unmount when we cleanup

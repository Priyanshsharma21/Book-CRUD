 Use to track state (data or property) of application
 Hook cant condition
 hook call at top and only use in funciton
 
 
 1.-> Use state

import react, {useState} form './react' // we dstriucture the useState here 

const [variable, setVariable] = useState(defaultValue)
!we have current state and function that update that state


  DefaultValue can be :-
    1. String - "" or "Anything you pass"
    2. Object - {}
    3. Array - []


!1.
function example(){
    const [color,setcolor] = useState("red")
    return (
        <h1>My fab color is {color}</h1>
    )
}

we cant just chage the state like this 
! color = "red" // not allowed
Use setColor function for this

Note -> can have multipe useState hooks


function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
      >Blue</button>
    </>
  )
}



3. Can use object in state 

function Car(){
    const details = {
        name : "Mustange"
        model : "191147"
        color : "red"
    }

    const [car,setCar] = useState(details)

    return (
    <h1>This is my {car.name} and this is of {car.color} and i love this model {car.model}</h1>
    )
}


If we only what to override the change part we can use spread operator 

funciton car(){
    const details = {
        name : "Mustange"
        model : "191147"
        color : "red"
    }

    const [car,setCar] = useState(details)

    function changeColor(){
        setColor((prevState)=>{
            return (...prevState, color:"blue")
        })
    }

    !this make it compare previous version of dom compare with new version and change only the color rarther than model and all overriden

    return (
    <h1>This is my {car.name} and this is of {car.color} and i love this model {car.model}</h1>
    <button onClick={changeColor}>click me to change</button>
    )
}


When making custome hook it start with use, resone is it is a naming convention and also we know that hooks cant be condition so naming custome hook with useName halp us to distinnguesh

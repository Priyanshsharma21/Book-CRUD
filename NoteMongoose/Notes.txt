Mongoose is Object Data Modeling for Mongodb and Nodejs
We can store our data in json format which reduce the complaxity of your application
It represent relation, provide schema validation and store objects in the database





Collection -> Like tables in sql, we can have multiple collections like user, product
Document -> Equivalent to row in sql.
Fields -> Attributes, just like column in tables
Schema -> How your data looks like, structure of database    
Model -> Higher order constructor which take document and create instance of it in database
Query -> the query you are going to make

Initialy data is been stored as binary object model which is expencive
virtuals are not stored in mongoose db
they are just use to set and get the value from the db
